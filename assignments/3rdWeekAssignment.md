It was extremely interesting to watch my requets turn into a functioning tsx file in a matter of seconds. 
Although it was amazing to see how even simple prompts were able to be processed in a satisfying way, I learned that 
I had to be very detailed about specific features I wanted in the app/platform for them to appear in the correct manner.
When experimenting with a different app (I first tested v0 by asking it to create a typing speed tester), it actually
failed to fulfil my prompt when I asked it to add a background and text color selection feature -- the background 
initially remained empty (white) until I gave more detailed descriptions about the issue and how I wanted the 
background color selection feature to work. 

I decided to work on something different from the typing speed tester as I wanted to test the capabilities of adding
different pages. v0 was able to fulfil my request of separate pages with differing conditions but I was not able to 
get v0 to create more than one tsx file for a single platform/app.
