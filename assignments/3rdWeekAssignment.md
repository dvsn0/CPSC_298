I initially had some problems setting up aider my uv install was not working correctly. When this issue was fixed, aider failed to recognize neither of my 
OpenAI or Groq API and was not able to edit my code. To overcome such a predicament, I was able to set up my API keys as environemnt variables (.env file)
and echoed it to .gitignore so that my API keys would not be visible in the repo.

It was extremely interesting to watch my requets turn into a functioning tsx file in a matter of seconds. Although it was amazing to see how even 
simple prompts were able to be processed in a satisfying way, I learned that I had to be very detailed about specific features I wanted in 
the app/platform for them to appear in the correct manner. When experimenting with a different app (I first tested v0 by asking it to create a 
typing speed tester), it actually failed to fulfil my prompt when I asked it to add a background and text color selection feature -- the 
background initially remained empty (white) until I gave more detailed descriptions about the issue and how I wanted the background color selection feature to work.

I decided to work on something different from the typing speed tester as I wanted to test the capabilities of adding different pages. v0 was able 
to fulfil my request of separate pages with differing conditions but I was not able to get v0 to create more than one tsx file for a single platform/app.
